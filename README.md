# IBVC
## Baseline

We offer a solution for training DCVC that can replicate the performance described in the article, and we have made the code openly available.

## Acknowledgement

The implementation is based on [DCVC](https://github.com/microsoft/DCVC/tree/main/DCVC) and [IFRNet](https://github.com/ltkong218/IFRNet).
